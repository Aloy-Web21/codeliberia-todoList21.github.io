  "description": "This is a Todolist web application that uses ejs templating for front-end and uses Node.js and Express for backend. The todo items are stored on a MongoDB database. Initially when you open the application you see three by default added items and you can add more items by adding yourselves and when you add an item a post route is triggered which creates a database item and stores it inside the relevant database. Each route URL has its own database created which stores separate data. You can just access a new route and then create a todolist for that specific route and I used Lodash npm package to format all routes.",
